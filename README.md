# Association Rule Learning - ARL

Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. Association theory responds to the needs of many sectors. This system is used from large supermarket chains to the applications we use to watch movies.

To explain through market chains, I would like to share a real-life example with you. Walmart, located in the USA, analyzed that alcohol products and diaper products have a significant relationship with each other in their analysis and arranged their aisles accordingly.
